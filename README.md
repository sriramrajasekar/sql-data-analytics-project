## SQL-Data-Analytics-Project

## üöÄ Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to use SQL to analyze e-commerce data focusing on customers, products, and orders. It highlights techniques to extract business insights such as revenue generation, sales trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.

## ‚úÖ What I Did  

- Designed and created a relational database with tables for **customers**, **products**, and **orders**  
- Loaded sample data into tables to simulate real-world e-commerce transactions  
- Executed SQL queries to answer key business questions:  
  - Total revenue and revenue by region  
  - Top selling products and categories  
  - Most valuable customers based on spending  
  - Monthly sales trends  
  - Profit generated by products  
  - Customer acquisition trends  

---

## ‚úÖ Key Skills Applied  

- SQL table design and foreign key constraints  
- Data aggregation with `SUM()`, `GROUP BY`, and filtering  
- Joining multiple tables for comprehensive analysis  
- Date functions to analyze trends over time  
- Business problem-solving using SQL analytics

## üìÅ Files Included  

- SQL script for database creation, data insertion, and queries  
- Sample data in SQL format for testing and demonstration

## üìä Key SQL Queries & Business Insights

1. **Total Revenue Generated**

```sql
SELECT SUM(p.selling_price * o.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

2. **Top 3 Selling Products by Revenue**

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, 
       SUM(o.quantity) AS total_sold_unit, 
       SUM(p.selling_price * o.quantity) AS revenue
FROM products p
JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

3. **Revenue by Region**

```sql
SELECT region, 
       SUM(p.selling_price * o.quantity) AS revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

4. **Top Customers by Total Spend**

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, 
       SUM(o.quantity * p.selling_price) AS total_spend
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;
```

5. **Monthly Sales Trend (Year-wise)**

```sql
SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS Year,
       MONTH(order_date) AS Month,
       SUM(p.selling_price * o.quantity) AS Total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY Year, Month
ORDER BY Year, Month;
```

6. **Region Generating Highest Sales Revenue**

```sql
SELECT region,
       SUM(p.selling_price * o.quantity) AS revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

7. **Top 2 Customers by Total Spend**

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name,
       SUM(p.selling_price * o.quantity) AS total_spend
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN products p ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

8. **Most Popular Product Category**

```sql
SELECT p.category, 
       SUM(o.quantity) AS Total_sold_unit
FROM products p
JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY Total_sold_unit DESC;
```

9. **Profit Generated by Each Product**

```sql
SELECT p.product_name,
       SUM((p.selling_price - p.cost_price) * o.quantity) AS Product_profit
FROM products p
JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY Product_profit DESC;
```

10. **New Customers Acquired by Month**

```sql
SELECT MONTH(signup_date) AS Month,
       COUNT(*) AS new_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
```
